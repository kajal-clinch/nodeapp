### Packages for development
List of packages needed for development.

* [`Express`](https://expressjs.com/) - Express.js, or simply Express, is a back end web application framework for Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs. It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.
* [`Typescript`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - TypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language.
* [`Axios`](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) - Axios is a Promise-based HTTP client for JavaScript which can be used in your front-end application and in your Node. js backend. By using Axios it's easy to send asynchronous HTTP request to REST endpoints and perform CRUD operations. Supports the Promise API. Intercept request and response.
* [`Mongoose`](https://mongoosejs.com/) - Mongoose provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application data. It includes built-in type casting, validation, query building, business logic hooks and more, out of the box.
* [`CORS`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) - Cross-origin resource sharing is a mechanism that allows restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the first resource was served. A web page may freely embed cross-origin images, stylesheets, scripts, iframes, and videos.
* [`Dotenv`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) - The dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a . env file into process. env .
* [`Joi`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/joi) - A powerful schema description language and data validator for JavaScript.
* [`Body-parser`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser) - Parse incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, available under the req.body property. 
* [`Swagger-ui-express`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-ui-express) - This module allows you to serve auto-generated swagger-ui generated API docs from express, based on a swagger.json file. The result is living documentation for your API hosted from your API server via a route.
* [`Eslint`](https://eslint.org/) -  ESLint is a static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns found in JavaScript code.
* [`Jest`](https://jestjs.io/) - Jest is a JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase.
* [`log4js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/log4js) - log4j is a tool to help the programmer output log statements to a variety of output targets.
* [`Nodemon`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) - nodemon is a tool that helps develop node. js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.
*  [`Prettier`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier) - Prettier is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.
*  [`Supertest`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier) - The motivation with this module is to provide a high-level abstraction for testing HTTP, while still allowing you to drop down to the lower-level API provided by superagent.
